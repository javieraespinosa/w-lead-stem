# Estimating the approximate earthquake epicentres

Seismic stations collect signals that can represent earthquakes produced in a specific area. The challenge is to determine whether signals actually represent earthquakes in such a case compute the epicentres.

### Data sets: Seismic stations

<Here description of the data including format, attributes and a short description in natural language>

The dataset is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ztekCKKQtslHdATup9h3KQWmVvERtyHC?usp=sharing

### To Do

cUse Kaggle or Collab for developing your solution. We do not ask for a finalised application but for a data science study that you can report on a clean, documented notebook. You can choose to use any underlying execution tool you need, a database system for dealing with your data, or a library.

#### Part I: Questions

1. Provide a dataset study with a quantitative analysis of the data that goes beyond what Kaggle     automatically produces.
2. Compute the direction of the earthquake epicentre. Use the sensor’s initial movement polarity when the waves P and S are discovered.
3. Compute the distance considering how the sensor moves from North-South (it should be the same as the East-West), as shown in Figure 1.1.
4. Propose an assessment strategy with metrics for determining the “performance” of your results.
5. Report and plot your results, including an explanation of the results.

#### Part II: Questions

1. Now the objective is to use the dataset to locate the earthquakes.
2. You can plot a map to show your results.
