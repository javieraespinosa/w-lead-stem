**Topics** 
- Applying statistical methods to investigate and unveil new geophysical data patterns, answer open problems, or lead to further research questions.
- Building predictive models to describe better or approximate geophysical phenomena, increasing our knowledge about our planet.
- Parallelizing algorithms for processing geophysical data, allowing for the processing of extensive data sets in reasonable times.


Experiments will provide the ground to devise new data curation approaches to define new techniques for processing heterogeneous data. In addition, statistical knowledge is essential for extracting information from the massive amount of data we will process. New methods and models will be crucial to model data and make conclusions in a timely fashion.
