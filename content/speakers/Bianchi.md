Monitoring earthquakes is the most basic task in seismology. The Brazilian Seismographic Network is a continental-wide network with more than 90 stations that are used to monitor Brazilian seismicity. While the network is a revolution in terms of available data most of the events in Brazil continue to be declared by visually analyzing day-plots records. We lack well-defined parameters and even, adapted procedures to search for events recorded by the network or a subset of it. The traditional process of declaring a new earthquake involves the detection of seismic phases arrival times, mainly P- and S-wave on continuous records, that later must be sorted and finally grouped to nucleate possible events while false detections must be discarded. The most simple and used detection algorithm is the STA/LTA method that returns detection times from continuous records.  The nucleation is a delicate process that normally works well on the global scale, or just when detection times of different events and phases are not mixed in time. Since earthquake position and origin time are not known, it is impossible to compute theoretical travel times at this stage. The information available is restricted to station coordinates and detection times. In some cases, instead of using detection time, the full detection waveform can be used. In that case, events must be nucleated directly from waveforms instead of considering the individual detection times.

### Bio

**Marcelo Bianchi** is currently a professor at the Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas from Universidade de São Paulo, where he develops research in the area of seismology, basically with the development of methods and procedures for detecting seismic events and studies of crust and mantle structure. He was also during the years of 2009-2010 a research scientist working for Schlumberger Stavanger Research Center in Norway and later a researcher inside the GEOFON group in Potsdam/Germany. He has experience with different programming languages, developing from small processing scripts to intermediate size, complex object-oriented programs to manage and process seismological data.
