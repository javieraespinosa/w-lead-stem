Since the 1970s, the availability of earth observation data has steadily increased. For instance, the well-known series of Landsat missions (among the most prominent, 1 in 1972, 5 in 1984, 7 in 1999, 8 in 2013 and 9 in 2021); MODIS (Terra in 1999 and Aqua in 2002); Aster (1999); Quickbird (2001); and the Copernicus program with its 5 Sentinels missions (in orbit from 2015). Furthermore, images captured under demand by drones also increase this list. Therefore, in the last two decades, not only the available satellites for monitoring the earth's physical, climate and environmental variables have increased, but also the periodicity, amount and details of such images have also augmented and improved. In this context, the geosciences have not been excluded from these transformations. New challenges and opportunities have emerged for big, multi-dimensional and multi-temporal data storage and analysis. This talk presents "The what, where and when of space-time cubes" and focuses on describing the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data structure known as space-time cubes. First, its dimensions will be conceptualized using the rubik's cube metaphor; second, applications of satellite images' time series for climate and environmental variables will be shown; finally, software tools implementing spatio-temporal cubes will be presented.

### Bio

**Daniela Ballari** is land surveyor by National University of CÃ³rdoba in Argentina (2014), and obtained her Ph.D by Wageningen University in the Netherlands (2012). Currently, she is Professor at University of Azuay (Cuenca, Ecuador). Her research deals with geostatistical and spatio-temporal methods for climate and environmental studies. She is passionate about spatial optimization, open geo-data, in-situ and remote data integration, as well as cartographic and scientific communication. She has been involved in academic and research activities in several countries such as Argentina, Ecuador, Spain, Netherlands, Cuba, Panama and Colombia. Recent publications are available at: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6926-4827.
