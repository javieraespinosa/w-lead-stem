Vast collections of heterogeneous data have become the backbone of scientific, analytic and forecasting processes to understand and predict physical phenomena. In this context, data must go through complex and repetitive analytical processes called “data science pipelines”.

The enactment of data science pipelines involves the balance of different services: (i) hardware (computing, storage and memory), (ii) communication (bandwidth and reliability), and (iii) scheduling of greedy in-memory analytical operations. Current data science environments (e.g., Google Colab, Kaggle) make these aspects transparent to final users. However, understanding how these environments integrate these computational services is key for running data science pipelines at different scales.

This lecture introduces current data science platforms and stacks and illustrates their usage for implementing basic data science pipelines in notebooks. The objective is to give you practical elements for helping you run, reproduce and share results when working in local and cloud environments.

### Bio

**Javier A. Espinosa-Oviedo** is a computer scientist working in the domains of databases and distributed systems. More specifically, Big Data management and processing, cloud computing, and data-centric systems design. He currently works as postdoctoral researcher at the University of Lyon in France. He is also former researcher of the Delft University of Technology, the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, the Grenoble Informatics Laboratory and the CNRS French-Mexican Laboratory of Informatics and Automatic Control. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Grenoble in 2013 and his master and bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Computer Systems Engineering, from UDLAP, in Mexico, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.
