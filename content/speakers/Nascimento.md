Data plays a central role in understanding Earth's systems and is a vital asset to assess how we find, extract and manage our natural resources (from the cradle to the grave). Additionally, data is pervasive in every aspect of evaluating the impact of our activities on the environment. More specifically, geoscientific data can be acquired, stored, retrieved, processed in many different ways and demands a broader interaction between data science and geoscientific communities. In this talk, I briefly introduce geoscientists' way of thinking and show how both communities can benefit from each other's profiles to set the track to address many challenges we face concerning energy, hazards, and the environment.

### Bio

**Aderson do Nascimento** is a Professor in the Department of Geophysics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil. He holds a BSc (Physics) and M.Sc. (Geophysics) both from UFRN and a Ph.D. (Geophysics) from the University of Edinburgh. His main research interests are man-associated and natural earthquakes and seismic interferometry. Since joining UFRN, he has also been actively involved in planning the Geophysics Department and the Geophysics undergraduate program. He has served terms as Director of Studies for the Physics and Geophysics programs (this later with a deputy role) and as the Deputy International Officer for UFRN from 2011 until 2017. From 2005 to 2011, he also was the NE Brazil Regional Secretary for the Brazilian Geophysical Society. Since 2012 he has been the Coordinator of UFRN’s Seismological Lab. (LabSis/UFRN). Recently has been appointed as UFRN’s representative at the federal government’s public policy REATE 2020 (Program of Revitalization for the Activity of Exploration and Production of Oil and Natural Gas on Land Areas). He also has been a PI in several projects funded by both the public and the private sector.
