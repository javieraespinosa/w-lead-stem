This course will provide students with an introduction to scalable Machine Learning. I will describe recent work on scalable clustering. By this course, I would like to teach students that the construction of scalable models is not necessarily associated with strictly computer engineering. The traditional steps of modeling and estimation remain essential. The course will be followed by a short Lab session using spark-notebook.io.


### Bio

**Mustapha Lebbah** is currently Associate Professor at the University of Paris 13 and a member of Machine learning Team A3, LIPN. His main researches are centered on machine learning and data mining (Unsupervised Learning, Self-organizing map, Probabilistic and Statistic, scalable machine learning and data science). Graduated from USTO University where he received his engineer diploma in 1998. Thereafter, he gained an MSC (DEA) in Artificial Intelligence from the Paris 13 University in 1999. In 2003, after three year in RENAULT R&D, he received his PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Versailles. He received the "Habilitation Ã  Diriger des Recherches" (accreditation to lead research) degree in Computer Science from Paris 13 University in 2012. He is a member of the french group in "complex data mining", and Secretary for the French Classification Society since november 2012.
