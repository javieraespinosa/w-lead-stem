The use of computers to solve complex problems has made significant progress in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this progress weighty depends on human experts to perform manual tasks  such as hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, and dynamic algorithm configuration. As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-experts, a demand for off-the-shelf methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge has emerged. This  research area that targets progressive automation of methods is called Automation  machine learning. Among those algorithms, deep learning, particularly deep convolutional neural networks have shown very good success and attracted attention from industry people and researchers in computer vision and image processing, neural networks, and machine learning. Our approach relies on evolutionary computation techniques (ES). ES started playing a significant role in automatically determining deep structures, transfer functions, and parameters to tackle image classification tasks, and have great potential to advance the developments of deep structures and algorithms. This talk will provide an extended view of deep learning, overview the state-of-the-art evolutionary deep learning using Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically evolving deep structures. Applications will be described on Image classification, image segmentation, and natural language processing.

### Bio

**Aurora Pozo**  is currently a Professor of Computer Science at Universidade Federal do Paraná, where she heads the interdisciplinary Evolutionary Computation Research Group. Her scientific contributions are in the area of ​​computational intelligence, mainly focused on machine learning, and particularly in evolutionary computation and learning (using genetic programming, particle swarm optimization, and learning classifier systems), big dimensionality reduction, computer vision, and image processing, multi-objective optimization,  and evolutionary deep learning. In addition to technical contributions in the area of ​​computational intelligence, Aurora works to consolidate the area in Brazil, actively participating in events related to the area (BRACIS, ENIAC, CTDIAC). Having already organized the events and coordinated the BRACIS program committee. The bidder has coordinated CNPq Universal and Fundação Araucária projects in the area of ​​bioinspired computing and applications. The projects have the collaboration of professors from different Universities in the State of Paraná, such as the State University of Ponta Grossa and the State University of the Center-West. Internationally, she coordinated a project MCT/CAPES/CNPq PVE 400125/2014-5 which allowed fruitful cooperation with the University of the Vasco Country/Spain. She has participated as a scientific editor in special issues in the journal Natural Computing (2018), Neurocomputing (2015), in the Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society (JBCS 2015). She has also participated as a reviewer for different international scientific journals such as IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computation, Applied Soft Computing, Neurocomputing, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation and Information Sciences. Member of international conference program committees such as “Conference on Hybrid Intelligent System” and “Conference on Evolutionary Multi-criterion Optimization”. And nationally, she was co-chair of the Theses and Dissertations Contest in Artificial and Computational Intelligence (2018-2020). As well as a member of the CSBC Thesis and Dissertations Contest committees (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018), among others. In addition to these activities, during this period, she has been dedicated to the training of human resources, continuously training masters and doctors. As well, it has published several articles in periodicals and conferences of recognized quality.
