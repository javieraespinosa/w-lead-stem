<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
<p>Since the 1970s, the availability of earth observation data has steadily increased. For instance, the well-known series of Landsat missions (among the most prominent, 1 in 1972, 5 in 1984, 7 in 1999, 8 in 2013 and 9 in 2021); MODIS (Terra in 1999 and Aqua in 2002); Aster (1999); Quickbird (2001); and the Copernicus program with its 5 Sentinels missions (in orbit from 2015). Furthermore, images captured under demand by drones also increase this list. Therefore, in the last two decades, not only the available satellites for monitoring the earth&rsquo;s physical, climate and environmental variables have increased, but also the periodicity, amount and details of such images have also augmented and improved. In this context, the geosciences have not been excluded from these transformations. New challenges and opportunities have emerged for big, multi-dimensional and multi-temporal data storage and analysis. This talk presents &ldquo;The what, where and when of space-time cubes&rdquo; and focuses on describing the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data structure known as space-time cubes. First, its dimensions will be conceptualized using the rubik&rsquo;s cube metaphor; second, applications of satellite images' time series for climate and environmental variables will be shown; finally, software tools implementing spatio-temporal cubes will be presented.</p>

<p class=mt-1>Marcelo Bianchi</p>

<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
<p>Monitoring earthquakes is the most basic task in seismology. The Brazilian Seismographic Network is a continental-wide network with more than 90 stations that are used to monitor Brazilian seismicity. While the network is a revolution in terms of available data most of the events in Brazil continue to be declared by visually analyzing day-plots records. We lack well-defined parameters and even, adapted procedures to search for events recorded by the network or a subset of it. The traditional process of declaring a new earthquake involves the detection of seismic phases arrival times, mainly P- and S-wave on continuous records, that later must be sorted and finally grouped to nucleate possible events while false detections must be discarded. The most simple and used detection algorithm is the STA/LTA method that returns detection times from continuous records. The nucleation is a delicate process that normally works well on the global scale, or just when detection times of different events and phases are not mixed in time. Since earthquake position and origin time are not known, it is impossible to compute theoretical travel times at this stage. The information available is restricted to station coordinates and detection times. In some cases, instead of using detection time, the full detection waveform can be used. In that case, events must be nucleated directly from waveforms instead of considering the individual detection times.</p>

<p>This course will provide students with an introduction to scalable Machine Learning. I will describe recent work on scalable clustering. By this course, I would like to teach students that the construction of scalable models is not necessarily associated with strictly computer engineering.

<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
<p>The use of computers to solve complex problems has made significant progress in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this progress weighty depends on human experts to perform manual tasks such as hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, and dynamic algorithm configuration. As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-experts, a demand for off-the-shelf methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge has emerged. This research area that targets progressive automation of methods is called Automation machine learning. Among those algorithms, deep learning, particularly deep convolutional neural networks have shown very good success and attracted attention from industry people and researchers in computer vision and image processing, neural networks, and machine learning. Our approach relies on evolutionary computation techniques (ES). ES started playing a significant role in automatically determining deep structures, transfer functions, and parameters to tackle image classification tasks, and have great potential to advance the developments of deep structures and algorithms. This talk will provide an extended view of deep learning, overview the state-of-the-art evolutionary deep learning using Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically evolving deep structures. Applications will be described on Image classification, image segmentation, and natural language processing.</p>

<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
<p>Data plays a central role in understanding Earth&rsquo;s systems and is a vital asset to assess how we find, extract and manage our natural resources (from the cradle to the grave). Additionally, data is pervasive in every aspect of evaluating the impact of our activities on the environment. More specifically, geoscientific data can be acquired, stored, retrieved, processed in many different ways and demands a broader interaction between data science and geoscientific communities. In this talk, I briefly introduce geoscientists' way of thinking and show how both communities can benefit from each other&rsquo;s profiles to set the track to address many challenges we face concerning energy, hazards, and the environment.</p>

<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
<p>Vast collections of heterogeneous data have become the backbone of scientific, analytic and forecasting processes to understand and predict physical phenomena. In this context, data must go through complex and repetitive analytical processes called “data science pipelines”.</p>
<p>The enactment of data science pipelines involves the balance of different services: (i) hardware (computing, storage and memory), (ii) communication (bandwidth and reliability), and (iii) scheduling of greedy in-memory analytical operations. Current data science environments (e.g., Google Colab, Kaggle) make these aspects transparent to final users. However, understanding how these environments integrate these computational services is key for running data science pipelines at different scales.</p>
<p>This lecture introduces current data science platforms and stacks and illustrates their usage for implementing basic data science pipelines in notebooks. The objective is to give you practical elements for helping you run, reproduce and share results when working in local and cloud environments.</p>
